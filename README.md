### Project Description
BeeWise is an expense tracker web application that allows users to track their daily, weekly, and monthly expenses. It helps individuals manage their finances more efficiently by categorizing their expenses, setting goals, and tracking progress toward those goals.

### The Problem statement
Keeping track of daily expenses and sticking to a budget can be overwhelming. Many people find it challenging to manage their finances without a clear and simple way to track their spending and savings goals.

### The Solution
BeeWise makes budgeting easy and fun by categorizing your expenses (food, rent, etc.), tracking your progress in real-time, and sending helpful reminders. With BeeWise, you'll always be aware of where your money is going, and you’ll be one step closer to achieving your financial goals.
